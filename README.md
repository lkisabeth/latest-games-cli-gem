# Latest Video Games and Reviews

Welcome to the latest_games CLI gem! This program will scrape metacritic.com to provide you with a small database of the latest video games.  The content can be sorted by gaming platform (PS4, Xbox One, PC, etc.) and can display info such as metacritic review, description, release date, and genre. This gem will IGNORE games that do not yet have a metacritic review score posted!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'latest_games'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install latest_games

## Usage

Run: latest_games after installing the gem.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
